                        <br>
                        <q>He was what God made him, a great pleader. He had a sixth sense: he could see around corners. That is where his talents lay ... he was a very clear thinker ... But he drove his points home – points chosen with exquisite selection – slow delivery, word by word.</q>
                        <li><strong>1925:</strong>He was elected President of All India Postal Staff Union. Being a member of the Legislative Assembly, Jinnah pleaded forcefully for the rights of workers and struggled for getting a <q>living wage and fair conditions</q> for them.</li>

He worked to expand the League, reducing the cost of membership to two annas (⅛ of a rupee), half of what it cost to join the Congress. He restructured the League along the lines of the Congress, putting most power in a Working Committee, which he appointed. By December 1939, by an estimate the League had three million two-anna members.</li>
